Prodigy Data Science Internship Task-03

***Task-03: Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.***

Sample Dateset :- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing

***Note: It's not compulsory to use the provided dataset. Additionally, Data Science Interns can use tools like MS Excel, Power BI, Tableau & Google Sheets too.***
***You can also view my excel dataset. ***
